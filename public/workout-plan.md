## EXERCISE PAIRING GUIDE

### Supersets
Perform exercises with the same letter/number prefix as supersets:
- A1 followed by A2, then rest
- B1 followed by B2, then rest
- C1 followed by C2, then rest

### Tempo Guide
The 4-digit tempo code refers to:
- First digit: Eccentric/lowering phase (seconds)
- Second digit: Pause at bottom (seconds)
- Third digit: Concentric/lifting phase (seconds)
- Fourth digit: Pause at top (seconds)

Example: 3020 = 3s down, 0s pause at bottom, 2s up, 0s pause at top

### Rest Periods
- A-series: 90 seconds between supersets
- B-series: 75 seconds between supersets
- C-series: 60 seconds between supersets
- M-series: Minimal rest, focus on quality movement

### Progression Notes
- Start with weights that allow 3 reps in reserve (7/10 effort)
- Record "Done" to track completion
- Film specified exercises and send for form review
- Progressively increase weights when you can complete full rep ranges with good form
